php-Create-Read-Update-Delete is a helper class and library collection to enable 
basic content authoring to a mysql database via a web interface

given the database table and connection data (+ optional configuration) phpCRUD 
outputs a ready to use CRUD interface and supports editing based on field type 
with optional enhancements like datepickers, dropdown selects or radioboxes and 
customizable allowed actions and display filters

phpCRUD uses jquery, jqueryui as well as jqueryui datetime picker libraries
